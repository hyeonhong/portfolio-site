I've seen some expats living in Korea who have fallen out of love with Korea over time. One of the most well-known cases is the Canadian couple (Simon and Martina) who used to live in Korea for an extended period of time, only to move to Japan and share their negative experience in Korea afterwards.

<br />

There are also some ESL teachers who decide to leave Korea "in midnight", that is without notice before their contract is over and hence the term "midnight-run".

<br />

So what makes some expats difficult to stay in Korea? What are the biggest drawbacks of living in Korea as expats?

<br />

1. Overwhelming lack of common courtesy in public spaces

- Complete disregard for personal space

<br />

2. Having to be vigilant about not getting hit by cars at all times

<br />

3. Getting stared at for being foreigners especially by older men and women

<br />

4. Noise pollution in residential area (Good night sleep in peace can be hard to come by...)

<br />

5. Too much emphasis on appearance (People are being too shallow...)

<br />

6. Smoking and spitting in public

<br />

More to come ...
