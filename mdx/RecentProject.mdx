- Built with React Framework **Next.js**

- For styling, **Material-UI** & **emotion** were used to write css styles for the components.

- For user authentication, **Firebase** was used to provide the token-based authentication.

- For database access, **prisma** ORM was used to connect to the postgresql database.

- For content management, **strapi** was used to provide headless CMS, for which I have launched the separate instance on Heroku.
