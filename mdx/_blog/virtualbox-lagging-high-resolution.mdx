I've been using VirtualBox as a way to emulate the Windows environment.

The other day I upgraded my monitor to 4k and noticed immediately that Virtualbox started lagging substantially.

<br />

After doing some research, I ended up getting around the issue with the following solution: Use Remote Desktop!

<br />

1\. Download **Mircosoft Remote Desktop** from the Mac App Store and install it.

2\. On the guest VM (Windows), enable Remote Desktop

3\. Leave "Enable Server" unchecked on the VM Settings -> Display dialog

4\. Use the NAT option on the VirtualBox Network Dialog

5\. On the Network, click Advanced -> Port forwarding

6\. Enter an arbitary value for Name

7\. Protocol: TCP

8\. Host and Guest IP: blank

9\. Host port: 5030 (arbitrary but unused on my system)

10\. Guest port: 3389 (Remote desktop)

11\. Now, open the Mircosoft Remote Desktop and add a new PC.

12\. PC name: localhost:5030

13\. Provide the necessary credentials for the rest

14\. Launch the VM instance "headless" by shift + clicking the Start button in VirtualBox.
