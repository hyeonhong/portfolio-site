The following is the term paper I submitted for the Technical Writing class at UW in 2015. I'm trying to fill up some contents on my website and I can't come up with anything useful at the moment, so I'm throwing out my past writings here until I figure out which direction I choose to go for the contents.

## Introduction

Generally speaking, there are three ways to make payments and purchases: Cash, Debit card, or Credit card. The most traditional and old-fashioned way is to pay by cash. It is the simplest method and has its benefits in informal transactions. However, it is not always easy to carry large amount of cash on hand and there is a certain level of risk that cash might be stolen or lost. That is when credit and debit cards come in. Both payment methods are convenient and secure compared to carrying cash and you can use almost everywhere. Also, you can keep track of how much you spent on items, since the record is created for each transaction. Then, what is the difference between debit and credit cards? There are seven criteria in which you determine one is preferred to the other: Cash Withdrawal, Interest, Fees, Rewards and Credit Scores, Fraud Protection Policy, Warranties, Controlling Spending.

## Cash Withdrawal

When you swipe your debit card, the money is directly taken out of your bank account. This basic principle lets you have access to ATM and you can withdraw cash in your bank account for an immediate use. Also, there are many stores that allow you to withdraw cash at the register to the limited amount. Credit cards don’t provide the same convenience since credit cards are based on the principle that you are loaning money from the card issuer.

## Interest

You can think of having credit cards as having short-term loans (30 days). Basically, you are borrowing money from a card issuer to pay for what you need at the time. And when the time has come to pay up what you owed at the end of billing cycle and you have an outstanding balance, you will incur interest. While credit cards can come in handy when it comes to emergency situations in which you don’t have enough immediate funds, you should not forget that it is just a loan and that you will have to pay back later. Debit cards don’t offer the flexibility of deferring the payment, but you don’t have to worry about interest.

## Rewards and Credit Scores

Many credit cards come with extra benefits. It starts with the basic credit scores that you will reap when you don’t go over your credit limit and pay your bills on time. If you keep your account in good standing, the card issuer will have your account re-evaluated and even make you eligible for lower interest rates on loans and credit cards. In addition to the basic benefits, there are Rewards programs that offer you cash back in certain percentage of your overall transaction amount. Also, there are other benefits that most credit card users are not aware of such as travel insurance for foreign countries. Some debit cards offer rewards points as well, but it pales in comparison to credit cards’ benefits.

## Fraud Protection Policy

Both credit and debit cards provide protection for fraudulent transactions. However, much greater protection is guaranteed in credit cards. For example, VISA has a zero liability policy that protects customers as long as you report the suspicious transactions promptly. In general, your liability with credit cards is limited to $50 for fraudulent charges in worst case scenarios. With debit cards, on the other hand, you could be held liable up to $500 if you don’t report the fraudulent transfers within two business days.

## Warranties

Credit cards can offer warranties or insurance when something goes wrong with the purchase. On behalf of customers, the card holder weighs in on the dispute that their customers are involved in with the merchants. The biggest asset in fighting the disputes between you and the merchant is to have the power of a big company on your side to help you out. This is the area where debit cards falls short conspicuously.

## Controlling Spending

Debit cards take the money from the amount in your account you already own, while the credit cards loan you the money for a short period of time. This can make some people fall into the temptation of spending the easily accessible money without discipline. This habit of overspending can lead to going over the credit card’s limit and make matters worse down the road. Another thing to look out for is that some cards give you high spending limits, and you can end up splurging your way into a place where you may not want to be and having unnecessary debts after all. You can avoid all this if you are being smart about using credit cards, but if you don’t feel confident enough, you can always go with debit cards and avert the future headaches all together.

## Conclusion

Undoubtedly, there are advantages and drawbacks for choosing either debit or credit cards. Both payment methods are based on the fundamentally different principles that appeal to some people over others in various situations.

- If you are compulsive spenders that have a hard time controlling your shopping urges, your best option is to stay away from credit cards and stick with debit cards.
- If you highly value raising your credit scores and raking in rewards that come with cards, you are more suited for credit cards.
- If you don’t want to engage in the dispute matter and leave all the messy talks with the merchant to a card issuer, using credit cards will relieve your stress on that issue.
- If having access to ATM takes priority over all other things, debit cards may be the best answer.
