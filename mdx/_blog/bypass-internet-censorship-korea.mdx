If you have lived in Korea long enough to use the internet for something other than the access to the basic information,  
you quickly realize that certain sites are blocked by the Korean government.

<br />

When you access the blocked sites, you are greeted by the following warning screen.

<br />

So how do you get around the internet censorship that is imposed by the Korean government?

<br />

The most popular and common way to do it is use the VPN.  
However, there are two caveats with this approach.  

<br />

First, you will need to spend money on the VPN service since the free ones are usually not reliable and trustworthy.  
Second, the internet speed gets slower as you have to pass the traffic to the VPN server instead of directly to the end point.

<br />

Today, I'm going to show you how to bypass the censorship without VPN in Korea.
