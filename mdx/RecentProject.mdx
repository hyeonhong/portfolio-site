- Built with React Framework **Next.js** for SSR

- For styling, **Material-UI** & **Emotion** were used to write css styles for the components.

- For user authentication, **Firebase** was used to provide the token-based authentication.

- For database access, **Prisma** ORM was used to connect to the Postgresql database.

- For content management, **Strapi** was used to provide headless CMS, for which I have launched the separate instance on Heroku.
